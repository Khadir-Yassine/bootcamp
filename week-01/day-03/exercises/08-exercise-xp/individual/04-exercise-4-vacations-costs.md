### **🌟 Exercise 4 : Vacations Costs**

**Instructions**

Let’s create functions that calculate your vacation’s costs:

1. Define a function called `hotelCost()`.

  - It should ask the user for the number of nights they would like to stay in the hotel.
  - If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
  - The hotel costs $140 per night. The function should `return` the total price of the hotel.

2. Define a function called `planeRideCost()`.

  - It should ask the user for their destination.
  - If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a string, ask again.
  - The function should `return` a different price depending on the location.

  - “London”: 183$
  - “Paris” : 220$
  - All other destination : 300$

3. Define a function called `rentalCarCost()`.

  - It should ask the user for the number of days they would like to rent the car.
  - If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
  - Calculate the cost to rent the car. The car costs $40 everyday.

  - If the user rents a car for more than 10 days, they get a 5% discount.
  - The function should `return` the total price of the car rental.

4. Define a function called `totalVacationCost()` that returns the total cost of the user’s vacation by calling the 3 functions that you created above.
Example : The car cost: $x, the hotel cost: $y, the plane tickets cost: $z.
**Hint:** You have to call the functions `hotelCost()`, `planeRideCost()` and `rentalCarCost()` inside the function `totalVacationCost()`.

5. Call the function `totalVacationCost()`

6. **Bonus**: Instead of using a `prompt` inside the 3 first functions, only use a prompt inside the `totalVacationCost()` function. You need to change the 3 first functions, accordingly.

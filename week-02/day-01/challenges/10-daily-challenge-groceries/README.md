## **Instructions**

Using this object :

```javascript
let client = "John";

const groceries = {
    fruits : ["pear", "apple", "banana"],
    vegetables: ["tomatoes", "cucumber", "salad"],
    totalPrice : "20$",
    other : {
        paid : true,
        meansOfPayment : ["cash", "creditCard"]
    }
}
```

**Hint**: To do this daily challenge, take a look at today’s lesson *Pass By Value & Pass By Reference*

1. Create an arrow function named `displayGroceries`, that console.logs the 3 fruits from the `groceries` object. Use the **forEach** method.

2. Create another arrow function named `cloneGroceries`.
  
  - In the function, create a variable named `user` that is a copy of the `client` variable. (**Tip** : make the `user` variable equal to the `client` variable)
  
  - Change the `client` variable to “Betty”. Will we also see this modification in the `user` variable ? Why ?
  - In the function, create a variable named `shopping` that is equal to the `groceries` variable.
  
  - Change the value of the `totalPrice` key to 35$. Will we also see this modification in the `shopping` object ? Why ?
  - Change the value of the `paid` key to false. Will we also see this modification in the `shopping` object ? Why ?

3. Invoke the `cloneGroceries` function.

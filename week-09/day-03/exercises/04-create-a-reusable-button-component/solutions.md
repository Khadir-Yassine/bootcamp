# Create a Reusable Button Component — Solution

[Original assignment](README.md) · [Runnable workspace](../../../solutions/README.md) · [Implementation](../../../solutions/src/autobarista.jsx)

## How to run

From `week-09/solutions`, run `npm ci`, then `npm run dev`. Open the local address printed by Vite and choose **autobarista**.

## Approach and implementation

`BaseButton({text,color,action})` renders a real button using its color prop and runs action on click. A disabled prop supports busy states. The same component is reused for ordering, maintenance, serving, and restocking.

## Check the result

Open AutoBarista and exercise the corresponding panel. All hardware behavior is labelled and implemented as a local learning simulation.

## Validation and dependencies

See the [workspace guide](../../../solutions/README.md) for the tests, API configuration, and network-dependent checks. The solution uses actual React components; the original assignment remains above for comparison.
